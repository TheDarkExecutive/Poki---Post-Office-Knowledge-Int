POKI - The Middleman scanner for Post Offices across India

The platform, soon to be an app, was a submission for the POSTATHON-2025 Conducted by VIT-AP upon the inaugration of the university's new "GEN-Z" post office. 
Our site, POKI, helps in the processes of extracting information by scanning codes, handwriting on parcels and letters by the user and helps the middlemen scan and ensure the parcel or message has been recieved. The information is then saved as manifests, which can be downloaded as an excel sheet for future references. The platform supports 6 languages (5 Indian Languages + English) for ease of the postman or middleman. It supports hovering rather than clicks and store, saving time. 
One thing we did ponder upon was the occurence of wrong addresses, which is also integrated within the scanner. Upon scanning, the information retrieved will confirm if the address is right or wrong, helping the middleman without further notice if it should be sent out without causing chaos and wastage of time.
